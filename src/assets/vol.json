        "abstract": "Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is considered an instrument for improving a company's reputation with key stakeholders, generating revenue, and improving bottom-line results; however, rather than corporate organizations, most studies concentrated on Nigeria, a sovereign state. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the specific relationship between corporate social responsibility disclosure and its effects on asset returns and share prices, with specific reference to an oil firm such as Seplat Energy Plc in Nigeria. Nigeria. Ex-post facto or causal comparative designs were utilized because the study's data came from the annual reports of Seplat Energy Plc on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) and regression analysis were used to analyze this study. The results showed that corporate social responsibility indices are positively related to ROA, except size. Additionally, it was observed that the corporate social responsibility index explains 46.8% of the variance in ROA. Because the size and donation values on the t-calculated values of -1.089 and 0.620, respectively, are less than the t-tabulated value of 1.833. Based on the research findings, Seplat Petroleum Development Plc was found to have acknowledged the value of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and to be fulfilling its commitments to both internal and external stakeholders as well as the broader community. It was recommended that a law be enacted that will fix the minimum percentage of profit that organizations should spend on corporate social responsibility."

The population consisted of 146 producers, wholesalers, and retailers from nine purposively selected agribusinesses. A census approach was employed. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert scale. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized to analyze the collected data and determine the relationships between the study's concepts. The findings of the study indicated that both Channel Coordination and Channel Intermediaries have a significant positive effect on Agribusiness growth. However, the study did not find sufficient evidence to support a significant relationship between Channel Relationship and Agribusiness Growth. Based on the study's results, it is recommended that agribusinesses in Jos-North Local Government Area focus on strengthening coordination efforts within their distribution channels and strategically engage intermediaries to optimize their growth potential. Additionally, continuous monitoring and evaluation of distribution channel performance, fostering collaboration among agribusiness stakeholders, and conducting further research on the relationship between channel relationships and agribusiness growth are suggested."

Ocean Tourism does not have a significant effect the growth of the selected maritime companies in South-South Nigeria. The study recommends that Maritime companies should reconsider their investment strategies in marine biotechnology. Instead of allocating substantial resources to this sector, companies should focus on improving the efficiency and innovation of their existing operations. Conducting a detailed cost-benefit analysis can help identify more profitable areas for investment within the blue economy. Maritime companies should collaborate with local governments and tourism boards to develop and promote comprehensive tourism packages. These packages should include infrastructure improvements, marketing campaigns, and partnerships with travel agencies to attract more tourists and increase the economic benefits from this sector."

Descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing were also conducted to provide a comprehensive analysis. The findings revealed that all three components of market innovation had a positive and significant impact on SME performance. Specifically, new product/service introduction significantly enhanced SME growth and adaptability to market demands. Technology adoption was found to improve operational efficiency and competitive advantage, while engagement with start-up hubs provided essential resources and networking opportunities that further boosted SME performance. Based on these findings, several specific recommendations were made. It was suggested that SMEs should be supported in consistently introducing new products and services through partnerships that provide funding and resources for research and development. For technology adoption, increased access to affordable technological tools was recommended, facilitated by subsidies or tax incentives, along with robust infrastructure for internet connectivity and digital literacy programs.
